# Basic mean app

These are my notes to create a simple boilerplate for a full MEAN stack application

Steps done:
- git init
- npm init
- created github repo
- added express and basic node app
- added chalk for console highlighting

## The plan

- REST API and HATEOS (dev webserver, routes, get, post, put, patch, unit tests, unit http tests)
- OAuth/passport (local and github strategy, logout, save user in db, secure routes)
- Front-end basics (proxy, fetch, dev server for front-end, watching files and building, refactoring, testing)
- Front-end cosmetics (header, footer, menu, views, routes, secure routes, refactoring, testing)
- Front-end data (interfaces, services, refactoring, testing)
- e2e tests
- Best practices extracting POJO's, benchmark tests and optimalization
- Lessons learned
